      "answer": "Here\u2019s a Hive query that joins the `FACT_LIQUIDITY_SNAP` and `DIM_ACCOUNT` tables, grouping the `available_amt` into buckets by country:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    da.country,\n    CASE \n        WHEN fls.available_amt < 1000 THEN '0-999'\n        WHEN fls.available_amt >= 1000 AND fls.available_amt < 5000 THEN '1000-4999'\n        WHEN fls.available_amt >= 5000 AND fls.available_amt < 10000 THEN '5000-9999'\n        ELSE '10000+'\n    END AS available_amt_bucket,\n    SUM(fls.available_amt) AS total_available_amt\nFROM \n    FACT_LIQUIDITY_SNAP fls\nJOIN \n    DIM_ACCOUNT da ON fls.account_id = da.account_id\nGROUP BY \n    da.country, \n    CASE \n        WHEN fls.available_amt < 1000 THEN '0-999'\n        WHEN fls.available_amt >= 1000 AND fls.available_amt < 5000 THEN '1000-4999'\n        WHEN fls.available_amt >= 5000 AND fls.available_amt < 10000 THEN '5000-9999'\n        ELSE '10000+'\n    END\nORDER BY \n    da.country, \n    available_amt_bucket;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Join Condition:** The query joins `FACT_LIQUIDITY_SNAP` (aliased as `fls`) with `DIM_ACCOUNT` (aliased as `da`) on the `account_id`.\n- **Grouping:** It groups the results by `country` and the defined buckets for `available_amt`.\n- **Buckets:** The `CASE` statement creates buckets for `available_amt`:\n  - `0-999`\n  - `1000-4999`\n  - `5000-9999`\n  - `10000+`\n- **Aggregation:** It sums the `available_amt` for each bucket and country.\n- **Ordering:** The results are ordered by `country` and `available_amt_bucket`."

      "request": "snowflake sql unsettled notional per custodian for QG-SPARK, join FACT_TRANSACTIONS and DIM_ACCOUNT, handle fx if ccy != USD",
      "answer": "To calculate the unsettled notional per custodian for QG-SPARK, joining the `FACT_TRANSACTIONS` and `DIM_ACCOUNT` tables, and handling foreign exchange (FX) when the currency is not USD, you can use the following Snowflake SQL query:\n\n```sql\nWITH FX_RATES AS (\n    SELECT \n        ccy,\n        rate_to_usd\n    FROM \n        FX_TABLE  -- Replace with your actual FX rates table\n)\n\nSELECT \n    a.custodian_id,\n    SUM(\n        CASE \n            WHEN t.ccy = 'USD' THEN t.notional\n            ELSE t.notional * f.rate_to_usd\n        END\n    ) AS unsettled_notional\nFROM \n    FACT_TRANSACTIONS t\nJOIN \n    DIM_ACCOUNT a ON t.account_id = a.account_id\nLEFT JOIN \n    FX_RATES f ON t.ccy = f.ccy\nWHERE \n    t.status = 'UNSETTLED'  -- Assuming there's a status field to filter unsettled transactions\nGROUP BY \n    a.custodian_id\nORDER BY \n    a.custodian_id;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: `FX_RATES` is used to fetch the exchange rates for currencies other than USD.\n- **Join**: The `FACT_TRANSACTIONS` table is joined with the `DIM_ACCOUNT` table on `account_id`.\n- **Currency Handling**: The `CASE` statement checks if the currency is USD. If it is, it uses the notional directly; otherwise, it multiplies the notional by the corresponding FX rate.\n- **Filtering**: The query filters for unsettled transactions based on a hypothetical `status` field.\n- **Aggregation**: The results are grouped by `custodian_id` to get the total unsettled notional per custodian.\n\nMake sure to replace `FX_TABLE` with the actual name of your foreign exchange rates table and adjust any field names as necessary based on your schema."
