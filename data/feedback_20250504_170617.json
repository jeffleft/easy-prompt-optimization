    "content": "To create a ranked backlog view of your current Jira security tickets with OKR (Objectives and Key Results) weightings, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract Current Jira Tickets**:\n   - Pull the list of current security tickets from your Jira instance. This may include custom fields relevant to security and the current status of each ticket.\n\n2. **Identify OKR Weightings**:\n   - Determine the weightings assigned to each ticket based on your OKR framework. This could be a score based on how well the ticket aligns with company objectives or key results.\n\n3. **Rank Tickets**:\n   - Sort the tickets based on their OKR weightings. This could be a numerical value assigned directly or a combination of different metrics (e.g., urgency, impact).\n\n4. **Select Top 5**:\n   - From the ranked list, select the top 5 tickets that have the highest OKR weighting.\n\n5. **Present Findings**:\n   - Format these tickets in a clear view, including relevant details such as ticket ID, summary, status, OKR weighting, and responsible team member.\n\n### Sample Table Format\n\n| Rank | Ticket ID | Summary                          | Status     | OKR Weighting | Assigned To   |\n|------|-----------|----------------------------------|------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1    | SEC-101   | Critical vulnerability in API    | Open       | 95            | John Doe      |\n| 2    | SEC-102   | SQL Injection in user form       | In Progress| 90            | Jane Smith    |\n| 3    | SEC-103   | Misconfigured AWS security group  | Open       | 85            | Alex Turner    |\n| 4    | SEC-104   | Outdated SSL certificates        | Open       | 80            | Mike Brown    |\n| 5    | SEC-105   | Insufficient logging on servers  | Open       | 75            | Lisa White    |\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- Ensure that your team regularly reviews and updates the weightings and ticket statuses.\n- Consider using Jira queries (JQL) to automate the extraction of security tickets and their statuses for easier updates.\n- If needed, integrate this process with tools like Confluence or a reporting dashboard for ongoing visibility.\n\nIf you need assistance with specific Jira queries or further steps in your backlog management, let me know!"

Based on the definitions you've provided, we can create a formula to project the net cash position over 13 weeks using the following variables:\n\n1. **Starting Cash (A1)**: The amount of cash available at the beginning of the 13-week period.\n2. **Planned Total Outflows (B1)**: The total amount expected to be spent (cash outflows) over the 13 weeks.\n3. **Planned Total Inflows (C1)**: The total amount expected to be received (cash inflows) over the 13 weeks.\n\n### Formula for Projecting Cash Position:\nTo calculate the projected cash position at the end of the 13-week period, the formula can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ending Cash Position} = \\text{Starting Cash} + \\text{Planned Total Inflows} - \\text{Planned Total Outflows} \\]\n\n### Excel Formula:\nYou can enter the following formula in a cell (for example, D1) to calculate the ending cash position:\n\n```excel\n=A1 + C1 - B1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **A1**: This represents the starting cash available for use.\n- **C1**: This represents the planned total inflows for the 13 weeks.\n- **B1**: This represents the planned total outflows for the 13 weeks.\n\n### Calculation Breakdown:\n- **Starting Cash (A1)** adds to the total inflows (C1), which represents the income expected during the time period.\n- **Planned Total Outflows (B1)** is subtracted from the sum of starting cash and inflows, reflecting the expenses that will reduce the total cash.\n\n### Final Result:\n- The result in cell D1 will give you the projected cash balance at the end of the 13-week period. \n- If the result is positive, it indicates that you will have cash remaining after all planned inflows and outflows. If the result is negative, it indicates a cash shortfall, meaning you will need to secure additional funding or reduce outflows to remain solvent. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional adjustments, feel free to ask!"

Based on what you've shared, I can draft an FAQ entry that accurately reflects the capabilities of QG-EDGE-X. Here\u2019s a revised version:\n\n### QG-EDGE-X: Payment/Telemetry Tokenization FAQ\n\n**Q: How does QG-EDGE-X achieve payment and telemetry tokenization while maintaining a latency under the 20ms budget?**\n\n**A:** QG-EDGE-X (Edge-Device Gateway Exchange) effectively manages payment and telemetry tokenization with a focus on maintaining latency under 20ms through several optimized approaches:\n\n1. **Edge Processing**: QG-EDGE-X handles tokenization in-flight at the network edge, specifically at card-present payment and IoT endpoints. This edge processing eliminates unnecessary round-trip delays to the cloud, ensuring rapid access and processing of data.\n\n2. **Deterministic Lightweight Cryptography**: The solution is built on deterministic lightweight cryptographic methods, which allow for a fast and secure tokenization process. This cryptographic approach ensures that transactions can be tokenized promptly without compromising security.\n\n3. **Streaming Mode**: QG-EDGE-X operates in a streaming mode, processing data in real-time as byte chunks arrive. This eliminates the need to buffer entire payloads before tokenization, significantly reducing latency and allowing for immediate action on incoming data.\n\n4. **Minimized Network Hops**: By running the tokenization process on edge appliances rather than centralizing processing in the cloud, QG-EDGE-X minimizes network hops. This streamlined architecture enhances speed and reduces latency for each transaction.\n\n5. **Proven Performance**: Recent QA team evaluations confirm the system's efficiency, with 99.97% of observed transactions completing the tokenization execution window in 18ms or less.\n\nThese features collectively ensure that QG-EDGE-X not only meets the requirements for rapid tokenization but also supports secure payment processing and telemetry management in real-time.\n\nIf you have further questions or need additional information about specific features, please contact our support team! \n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further adjustments or additional details included!"

Here\u2019s the revised version of the talking points, adhering strictly to your guidelines:\n\n### Talking Point 1: Event-Sourced Ledgers and Snapshots  \nWith the FLOW event-sourced ledger, you capture every transaction as an individual event, preserving the complete history of state transitions. Each transition generates a snapshot, which is stored in Parquet format. This method systematically organizes your data, resembling the meticulous documentation seen in archaeology, where each artifact represents a unique piece of the historical record.\n\n### Talking Point 2: Rewindable Ledger State  \nThe rewindable ledger allows you to access previous states of the financial record at any point in time. This capability mirrors the distinct strata found in archaeological sites, where each layer provides a snapshot of a particular phase of activity. You can review the ledger as it was at different moments, maintaining an accurate and unaltered record of changes.\n\n### Talking Point 3: Multi-GAAP Reporting  \nFLOW supports multi-GAAP reporting from any point in time by utilizing the historical data captured in the event-sourced ledger and its snapshots. You can generate financial reports aligned with various accounting principles, accessing the exact state of the ledger at your desired moment to meet your reporting requirements."

    "content": "Subject: Sprint-End Reflection and Next Steps\n\nHi Team,\n\nAs we wrap up this sprint, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on our accomplishments and share some thoughts on how we can continue to improve our process.\n\n**First, kudos to Adisa, Priya, and Chen!** Adisa debugged the mainframe commit bug in QG-LYNK (Legacy Integration Node Kit), while Priya and Chen made the glyph-book post-mortem template happen on a tight deadline. The hard work from each of you helped us achieve some solid outcomes this sprint. We released QG-LYNK v2.1 to staging, enabling our mainframe-generated Message Queue (MQ) workflows to emit protocol buffers (protobuf) events. Additionally, we resolved the backlog of ISO 20022 dispute message mismatches in QG-SPARK (Settlement Processing & Reconciliation Kit), achieving a test pass rate of 98%. Lastly, we published our first \u201cglyph-book\u201d client post-mortem following the QG-EDGE deployment incident, utilizing the new format to enhance our learning and documentation practices.\n\n**Now, let's focus on two areas for process improvement:**\n\n1. **Test Environment Configuration:** During this sprint, the hand-off between the backend and QA (Quality Assurance) teams for QG-SPARK was delayed due to missing test environment configuration. This resulted in a two-day setback for our full regression testing. To prevent this in the future, it may be beneficial to implement a checklist for environment readiness during hand-offs.\n\n2. **Reviewer Access Provisioning:** For the QG-LYNK adapter configuration review, we faced a bottleneck as the access for the reviewer was not provisioned on time. Looking ahead, we should consider streamlining our access request processes to ensure timely provisioning before critical review phases.\n\n**In summary, I'm proud of what we've accomplished together, and I truly believe that with these improvements in place, we can enhance our efficiency and effectiveness even further.** Thank you for your efforts and dedication. Let\u2019s keep pushing forward!\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n\n\u00a9 [Year] QuantGlyph Systems. All rights reserved."

    "content": "Thank you for the additional details. To address your requirements accurately, we will use a lateral join to ensure we fetch the latest FX rate prior to or at the transaction date (for non-USD transactions) while also skipping the join for USD transactions.\n\nHere's the revised SQL query using LATERAL for the appropriate join:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    da.custodian_code,\n    SUM(CASE \n            WHEN ft.notional_ccy = 'USD' THEN ft.notional_amt\n            ELSE ft.notional_amt * fs.spot \n        END) AS total_notional_usd\nFROM \n    FACT_TRANSACTIONS ft\nJOIN \n    DIM_ACCOUNT da ON ft.account_sk = da.account_sk\nLEFT JOIN LATERAL (\n    SELECT \n        fs.spot\n    FROM \n        FX_SPOT fs\n    WHERE \n        fs.from_ccy = ft.notional_ccy \n        AND fs.as_of_ts <= ft.as_of_ts\n    ORDER BY \n        fs.as_of_ts DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n) fs ON ft.notional_ccy <> 'USD'  -- Only join when not USD\nWHERE \n    ft.status = 'UNSETTLED'\nGROUP BY \n    da.custodian_code\nORDER BY \n    total_notional_usd DESC;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **LATERAL Join**: The LATERAL join allows us to reference the `FACT_TRANSACTIONS` table within the subquery that retrieves the FX rate from `FX_SPOT`. \n  - The subquery selects the latest `spot` rate for the corresponding `from_ccy` where its `as_of_ts` is less than or equal to the transaction's `as_of_ts`.\n  - We order by `fs.as_of_ts DESC` to get the latest rate prior to or at the transaction\u2019s date, and we limit the results to 1 to ensure we only get the most recent rate.\n- **Condition to Skip USD**: The condition `ft.notional_ccy <> 'USD'` is specified in the join to ensure we only attempt to fetch an FX rate for currencies that are not USD. This prevents unnecessary joins for USD transactions.\n- **SUM Calculation**: The `SUM` function aggregates at the custodian level, using either the notional amount directly for USD or multiplying by the spot rate for other currencies.\n\nThis query should appropriately handle your requirements for calculating total unsettled notional in USD per custodian, considering both FX rates and conditions regarding currency."

It\u2019s crucial to ensure that all those instances use the same pattern for safe execution.\n\n### Regarding Batch Insert\n\nUsing batch insert can indeed optimize the `load_users` function, especially if you're inserting multiple records. Instead of executing an insert for each user individually, you can structure your insert query to handle multiple records in a single operation, which is generally more efficient.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can implement a batch insert in the `load_users` function:\n\n### Refactored `load_users` Function with Batch Insert\n\n```python\ndef load_users(conn, user_records):\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n    insert_query = \"INSERT INTO clean_users (user_id, username, email) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)\"\n    # Prepare the data in tuple form for batch execution\n    data_to_insert = [(user[\"user_id\"], user[\"username\"], user[\"email\"]) for user in user_records]\n    \n    # Execute the batch insert\n    cur.executemany(insert_query, data_to_insert)\n    conn.commit()\n    cur.close()\n```\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n1. **Batch Processing with `executemany`**: Instead of looping through each user to execute an insert, I've changed it to use `cur.executemany()`, which takes a list of tuples for the parameterized query.\n\n2. **Efficient Data Preparation**: The data preparation creates a list of tuples containing user information, making it ready for the batch insertion, which can improve performance especially with larger datasets.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\nIf you\u2019re satisfied with the batch insert approach and the parameterization is consistent throughout your script, we can proceed to add unit tests for this ETL functionality. Just let me know if you want to cover specific aspects or if you have any particular requirements for the tests!"

    "content": "Implementing a Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol for an application that integrates with QG-LYNK requires a clear understanding of distributed transactions. Below, I will provide you with an example of how to implement 2PC adapters in Java, including rollback logic.\n\n### Overview of Two-Phase Commit Protocol\n\nThe Two-Phase Commit protocol consists of two distinct phases:\n1. **Voting Phase**: The coordinator asks all participants if they can commit the transaction.\n2. **Commit Phase**: If all participants agree to the commit, the coordinator instructs all participants to commit their changes. If any participant votes \"no,\" the coordinator instructs all participants to rollback.\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere\u2019s a simplistic implementation of a 2PC protocol in Java, where we simulate participants that can either vote to commit or rollback. This example assumes the existence of a `Participant` interface and a `TransactionCoordinator` class to manage the 2PC process.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\ninterface Participant {\n    boolean voteToCommit();\n    void commit();\n    void rollback();\n}\n\nclass DatabaseParticipant implements Participant {\n    private String name;\n    private boolean canCommit = true; // Simulating a participant that can initially commit\n\n    public DatabaseParticipant(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public void setCanCommit(boolean canCommit) {\n        this.canCommit = canCommit; // Can be changed to simulate failure\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean voteToCommit() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" voted to \" + (canCommit ? \"COMMIT\" : \"ROLLBACK\"));\n        return canCommit;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void commit() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" has committed the transaction.\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void rollback() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" has rolled back the transaction.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass TransactionCoordinator {\n    private List<Participant> participants;\n\n    public TransactionCoordinator(List<Participant> participants) {\n        this.participants = participants;\n    }\n\n    public void commitTransaction() {\n        boolean allAgree = true;\n\n        // Phase 1: Vote Phase\n        for (Participant participant : participants) {\n            if (!participant.voteToCommit()) {\n                allAgree = false;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Phase 2: Commit or Rollback Phase\n        if (allAgree) {\n            System.out.println(\"All participants agreed to commit. Committing...\");\n            for (Participant participant : participants) {\n                participant.commit();\n            }\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Not all participants agreed. Rolling back...\");\n            for (Participant participant : participants) {\n                participant.rollback();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class TwoPhaseCommitExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create participants\n        DatabaseParticipant participant1 = new DatabaseParticipant(\"Database1\");\n        DatabaseParticipant participant2 = new DatabaseParticipant(\"Database2\");\n\n        // Simulate one participant being unable to commit\n        participant2.setCanCommit(false);\n\n        // Add participants to the coordinator\n        List<Participant> participants = new ArrayList<>();\n        participants.add(participant1);\n        participants.add(participant2);\n\n        TransactionCoordinator coordinator = new TransactionCoordinator(participants);\n\n        // Execute the commit transaction\n        coordinator.commitTransaction();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Participant Interface**: This defines the methods that each participant must implement, which includes `voteToCommit()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()`.\n\n2. **DatabaseParticipant Implementation**: This class implements the `Participant` interface and simulates a database participant with a simple yes/no on whether it can commit.\n\n3. **TransactionCoordinator**: This class handles the two phases of the 2PC process. It first checks the votes of all participants, and if they all agree, it commits. If any participant votes against, it rolls back the transaction.\n\n4. **Main Class**: In the main method, two `DatabaseParticipant` instances are created. One is forced to roll back to simulate failure. The `TransactionCoordinator` then manages the commit operation.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This implementation is basic and meant for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would have to account for things like network failures, timeouts, and distributed logging.\n- QG-LYNK may provide specific APIs or frameworks for transaction management that could simplify implementing 2PC. Adjust the code to fit the APIs provided by QG-LYNK as necessary.\n- Ensure the concurrent handling of participants if your application runs in a multi-threaded environment."

    "content": "Thank you for the clarification! Let's focus on a Two-Phase Commit (2PC) adapter that integrates with IBM MQ or IMS for sending messages or transactions. I'll provide a more realistic Java code structure that represents how you might implement this kind of adapter specifically for the legacy integration scenarios you mentioned.\n\n### Conceptual Overview\n\nThe implementation will involve creating a 2PC adapter that wraps the process of sending messages to an MQ queue or executing an IMS transaction. The adapter will handle the two-phase commit logic, which will be used to manage the commit or rollback of transactions.\n\n### Example Implementation\n\nIn this example, I'll create an adapter that could potentially wrap around an IBM MQ send operation. If you provide MQ or IMS message publishing code, I could integrate that into this adapter structure meaningfully.\n\nHere's a simplified version of how you might structure this:\n\n```java\nimport javax.jms.*;\nimport com.ibm.mq.jms.MQQueueConnectionFactory;\nimport com.ibm.mq.jms.MQQueue;\nimport com.ibm.mq.jms.MQQueueSender;\nimport com.ibm.mq.jms.MQQueueSession;\n\ninterface MessageParticipant {\n    boolean voteToCommit();\n    void commit() throws JMSException;\n    void rollback() throws JMSException;\n}\n\nclass MQMessageParticipant implements MessageParticipant {\n    private final MQQueue queue;\n    private final MQQueueSender sender;\n    private final String messageBody;\n    private boolean readyToCommit = true;\n\n    public MQMessageParticipant(MQQueue queue, String messageBody) throws JMSException {\n        this.queue = queue;\n        this.sender = queue.createQueueSender();\n        this.messageBody = messageBody;\n    }\n\n    public void setReadyToCommit(boolean readyToCommit) {\n        this.readyToCommit = readyToCommit; // Simulating if the participant is ready to commit\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean voteToCommit() {\n        System.out.println(\"Participant voting to \" + (readyToCommit ? \"COMMIT\" : \"ROLLBACK\"));\n        return readyToCommit;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void commit() throws JMSException {\n        TextMessage message = sender.getSession().createTextMessage(messageBody);\n        sender.send(message);\n        System.out.println(\"Message sent: \" + messageBody);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void rollback() throws JMSException {\n        // Logic for rollback; depending on the system design this may vary.\n        System.out.println(\"Rolling back message: \" + messageBody);\n        // If any kind of state must be cleaned up, it would be done here.\n    }\n\n    public MQQueueSender getSender() {\n        return sender;\n    }\n}\n\nclass TransactionCoordinator {\n    private final List<MessageParticipant> participants;\n\n    public TransactionCoordinator(List<MessageParticipant> participants) {\n        this.participants = participants;\n    }\n\n    public void commitTransaction() throws JMSException {\n        boolean allAgree = true;\n\n        // Phase 1: Vote Phase\n        for (MessageParticipant participant : participants) {\n            if (!participant.voteToCommit()) {\n                allAgree = false;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Phase 2: Commit or Rollback Phase\n        if (allAgree) {\n            System.out.println(\"All participants agreed to commit. Committing...\");\n            for (MessageParticipant participant : participants) {\n                participant.commit();\n            }\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Not all participants agreed. Rolling back...\");\n            for (MessageParticipant participant : participants) {\n                participant.rollback();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class TwoPhaseCommitMQExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Setup JMS and MQ environment (pseudo-code, add actual connection details)\n        try {\n            MQQueueConnectionFactory factory = new MQQueueConnectionFactory();\n            // Set connection properties...\n\n            // Create connection\n            Connection connection = factory.createConnection();\n            connection.start();\n\n            // Create session\n            Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);\n            MQQueue queue = session.createQueue(\"QUEUE_NAME\");\n\n            // Create participants\n            MQMessageParticipant participant1 = new MQMessageParticipant(queue, \"Message 1\");\n            MQMessageParticipant participant2 = new MQMessageParticipant(queue, \"Message 2\");\n\n            // Example of making one participant unable to commit\n            participant2.setReadyToCommit(false);\n\n            // Add participants to the coordinator\n            List<MessageParticipant> participants = new ArrayList<>();\n            participants.add(participant1);\n            participants.add(participant2);\n\n            TransactionCoordinator coordinator = new TransactionCoordinator(participants);\n\n            // Execute the commit transaction\n            coordinator.commitTransaction();\n\n            // Clean up\n            session.close();\n            connection.close();\n        } catch (JMSException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **MessageParticipant Interface**: Defines methods for voting, committing, and rolling back. Each participant represents an MQ or IMS transaction.\n\n2. **MQMessageParticipant Class**: Implements the `MessageParticipant` interface for handling MQ transactions. It includes logic to simulate readiness to commit and contains methods for sending messages.\n\n3. **TransactionCoordinator Class**: Manages the two phases of the commit process by checking votes from participants and deciding whether to commit or rollback based on the responses.\n\n4. **Main Method**: Acts as a client to create connections and sessions for the MQ, instantiate participants, and initiate the commit transaction.\n\n### Setting Up IBM MQ Connection\n\nIn a real application, be sure to configure the `MQQueueConnectionFactory` with appropriate connection details like hostname, port, queue manager name, channel, and credentials.\n\nFeel free to provide the specific MQ or IMS message publishing code, and I can help integrate that into this structure."

    "content": "Thank you for providing the details about the QG-LYNK API and the IBM MQ operations. Based on this, I can illustrate how to implement a 2PC adapter that integrates with IBM MQ while fitting neatly into the `LynkAdapter` lifecycle.\n\n### Implementation of a 2PC Adapter for IBM MQ\n\nBelow is a Java class that extends `LynkAdapter`. It will encapsulate the IBM MQ operations for preparing, committing, and rolling back the message operations in a 2PC context.\n\n```java\nimport com.ibm.mq.MQException;\nimport com.ibm.mq.MQQueue;\nimport com.ibm.mq.MQQueueManager;\nimport com.ibm.mq.MQMessage;\n\npublic class MQ2PCAdapter extends LynkAdapter {\n    private MQQueueManager qMgr;\n    private MQQueue queue;\n    private String queueName;\n    private String messagePayload;\n\n    public MQ2PCAdapter(String queueName, String messagePayload, MQQueueManager qMgr) {\n        this.queueName = queueName;\n        this.messagePayload = messagePayload;\n        this.qMgr = qMgr;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void prepare(LynkContext ctx) throws Exception {\n        // Before attempting to put the message, we can perform relevant checks \n        // or any preliminary activities. In this context, we can set up our queue.\n        try {\n            queue = qMgr.accessQueue(queueName, MQC.MQOO_OUTPUT | MQC.MQOO_FAIL_IF_QUIESCING);\n            System.out.println(\"Queue \" + queueName + \" is ready for message put.\");\n        } catch (MQException e) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Failed to access queue: \" + e.getMessage(), e);\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void commit(LynkContext ctx) throws Exception {\n        // Attempt to put the message into the MQ queue\n        try {\n            MQMessage message = new MQMessage();\n            message.writeString(messagePayload);\n            queue.put(message);\n            qMgr.commit(); // Commit the put operation\n            System.out.println(\"Message committed: \" + messagePayload);\n        } catch (MQException e) {\n            qMgr.backout(); // Roll back if an error occurs\n            throw new Exception(\"Failed to commit message put: \" + e.getMessage(), e);\n        } finally {\n            // Clean up resources\n            if (queue != null) {\n                queue.close();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void rollback(LynkContext ctx) throws Exception {\n        try {\n            qMgr.backout(); // Roll back any pending puts\n            System.out.println(\"Message put rolled back.\");\n        } catch (MQException e) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Failed to rollback: \" + e.getMessage(), e);\n        } finally {\n            // Clean up resources\n            if (queue != null) {\n                queue.close();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Constructor**: The `MQ2PCAdapter` constructor accepts the queue name, the message payload, and the `MQQueueManager`. It sets up the required properties for the adapter to function.\n\n2. **prepare() Method**: This method is called before any resource changes. It attempts to access the specified queue and can include any additional checks or setups necessary before the commit phase.\n\n3. **commit() Method**: In this method:\n   - It creates a new `MQMessage`.\n   - The message is then sent to the queue with the `put()` method.\n   - If the `put()` operation succeeds, `qMgr.commit()` is called to commit the message.\n   - In case of an exception, it calls `qMgr.backout()` to revert any pending operations.\n\n4. **rollback() Method**: This method handles the rollback if required. It simply calls `qMgr.backout()` to ensure that any operations that were not committed are cleaned up.\n\n5. **Resource Management**: In both `commit()` and `rollback()` methods, the queue is closed to prevent resource leaks.\n\n### Usage Example\n\nTo use this adapter in a QG-LYNK process, you would typically create an instance of `MQ2PCAdapter`, invoke `prepare()`, followed by `commit()` or `rollback()` based on the transaction outcome, and manage the context per your application's requirements.\n\n```java\nLynkContext context = new LynkContext(); // Assume this is set up appropriately\nMQQueueManager qMgr = new MQQueueManager(\"QM1\");\nMQ2PCAdapter adapter = new MQ2PCAdapter(\"QUEUE1\", \"Your message payload\", qMgr);\n\ntry {\n    adapter.prepare(context);\n    // After deciding if it should commit or roll back based on some logic:\n    if (shouldCommit()) {\n        adapter.commit(context);\n    } else {\n        adapter.rollback(context);\n    }\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    // Handle exceptions\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure to handle the context for `LynkContext` as per your application needs.\n- The exception handling in this code is simplistic and could be expanded to include more specific error management and logging.\n- Modify queue parameters and configurations according to your IBM MQ environment setup. \n\nThis implementation directly integrates the native IBM MQ operations into the QG-LYNK operational context without unnecessary abstraction. If you have further refinements or specific requirements to adapt, feel free to indicate those!"

Since the table `FACT_LIQUIDITY_SNAP` is partitioned by `snap_dt` (which is of the DATE type), you will need to adjust your query to filter by this partition rather than `snap_ts`. \n\nIf you need to filter results based on a specific day or range of days, you can incorporate the `snap_dt` partition in your `WHERE` clause. If you also need to filter on timestamps for specific use cases (like querying data within a specific time range within the day), you can add additional conditions for that.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can structure your Hive query to efficiently prune partitions using the `snap_dt` column:\n\n### Example Query:\n```sql\nSELECT account_sk, available_ccy, available_amt\nFROM FACT_LIQUIDITY_SNAP\nWHERE snap_dt = 'YYYY-MM-DD' \n  AND snap_ts >= 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' \n  AND snap_ts < 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'\n```\n\n### Notes:\n1. **Partition Pruning:** The `WHERE snap_dt = 'YYYY-MM-DD'` clause helps in pruning partitions, which means Hive will only read data from the specified partition directory, improving performance.\n   \n2. **Timestamp Filtering:** If you want to filter results within that specific date using timestamp, you\u2019ll need to ensure that the `snap_ts` column exists in the table (it wasn't mentioned earlier) and that you're using appropriate filtering logic for it. \n\n### If You Only Need Daily Data:\nIf you're interested only in all data for a given date without the timestamp filtering, you can simplify the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT account_sk, available_ccy, available_amt\nFROM FACT_LIQUIDITY_SNAP\nWHERE snap_dt = 'YYYY-MM-DD'\n```\n\n### Performance Considerations:\n- Again, avoid using `SELECT *` unless you need all columns. Specifying only the columns you require (as shown above) will minimize data transfer and improve query performance.\n  \n- Monitor the execution time of this query. If it exceeds your 30-second requirement, consider further optimizations such as ensuring that the underlying data format is efficient (e.g., using Parquet) and possibly look into whether any indexing strategies might help.\n\n### Testing Incrementally:\nYou might want to test different sets of dates or narrower time ranges to analyze how the performance is impacted as you run queries on the partitions. \n\nLet me know if you need further adjustments or examples!"

This technical white paper delves into the robust architecture of QG-SPARK, elucidating its unparalleled efficiency in executing real-time transactions across the FedNow payment network and various cryptocurrency rails.\n\nBy leveraging the principles of cryptography and decentralized ledger technology, QG-SPARK ensures that transactions are irrevocably committed only when both the delivery of assets and payment are simultaneously executed. This dual assurance not only mitigates counterparty risk but also enhances liquidity, facilitating a more dynamic trading environment. Our solution is designed for interoperability, fostering a symbiotic relationship between centralized payment systems and decentralized finance frameworks.\n\nThroughout this document, we explore practical implementations, performance benchmarks, and the strategic advantages of integrating atomic DvP mechanisms into operational workflows. Aspiring to solidify trust and security in digital transactions, QG-SPARK stands at the frontier of financial technology, driving the future of commerce in the blockchain era. Join us as we unearth the potential of atomic DvP to transform the transactional landscape, ensuring that every exchange is both efficient and secure."

This capability operates across the FedNow payment network and supported cryptocurrency rails, effectively synchronizing transactions with the certainty of a cryptographic lock.\n\nAtomic DvP ensures that at no point is value transferred without a corresponding exchange, akin to a cryptographic mechanism that guarantees the integrity of data. This design fosters a precise transactional environment where each side's obligations are met simultaneously, ensuring a fail-safe process.\n\nIn cases where discrepancies occur, QG-SPARK automatically generates International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 20022 dispute messages and webhook callbacks. This function serves as an archaeological record, documenting mismatches in transactions and providing a clear path for resolution and audit.\n\nBy integrating these capabilities, QG-SPARK enhances transactional integrity across disparate systems\u2014anchoring the asset transfer process in reliable protocols and clear communication channels. This ensures that all interactions are consistent, transparent, and secure, reflecting the foundational principles of trust evident in both cryptography and archaeological practice."
