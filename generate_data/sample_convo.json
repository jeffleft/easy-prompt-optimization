This is a critical data privacy concern that needs to be addressed immediately.\n\n**Priority:** High (ASAP)\n\n**Action Needed:**  \n- Investigate the root cause of the zip code leakage.  \n- Implement a fix to ensure all sensitive location data is properly masked.  \n- Validate the fix through auditing and testing.\n\nWould you like a couple more versions depending on the style or system you're using (like Jira, Asana, Linear, etc.)?"
